# Idea
'''
1. Create a static grid which uses the object ids to create inflation and keepout zones in the grid
    a. Information we have -- object_ids and can use getAABB to find the locations/sizes of these objects
    b. Start point of robot
    c. Global origin at the center of a 51 x 51 grid (i.e. global origin at point 25, 25), points in grid are spaced 20cm apart so each cell is 20cm by 20cm
    d. Have a function to take a point x,y and determine which cell index it falls into
2. Use the grid to determine waypoints to navigate to using A*
3. Smoothen the trajectory
4. Apply inverse kinematics to go to those waypoints.
